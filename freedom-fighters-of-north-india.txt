The Indian Mutiny of 1857-59 was a widespread but unsuccessful rebellion against the rule of British East India Company in India which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British crown.

The Revolt
It was the first expression of organised resistance against the British East India Company
It began as a revolt of the sepoys of the British East India Company’s army but eventually secured the participation of the masses.
The revolt is known by several names: the Sepoy Mutiny (by the British Historians), the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion (by the Indian Historians), the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence (by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar).
Causes of The Revolt
Political Cause

British policy of expansion: The political causes of the revolt were the British policy of expansion through the Doctrine of Lapse and direct annexation.
A large number of Indian rulers and chiefs were dislodged, thus arousing fear in the minds of other ruling families who apprehended a similar fate.
Rani Lakshmi Bai’s adopted son was not permitted to sit on the throne of Jhansi.
Satara, Nagpur and Jhansi were annexed under the Doctrine of Lapse.
Jaitpur, Sambalpur and Udaipur were also annexed.
The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie on the pretext of maladministration left thousands of nobles, officials, retainers and soldiers jobless. This measure converted Awadh, a loyal state, into a hotbed of discontent and intrigue.
Doctrine of lapse:

The notable British technique called the Doctrine of Lapse was first perpetrated by Lord Dalhousie in the late 1840s.
It involved the British prohibiting a Hindu ruler without a natural heir from adopting a successor and, after the ruler died or abdicated, annexing his land.
To those problems added the growing discontent of the Brahmans, many of whom had been dispossessed of their revenues or had lost lucrative positions.
Social and Religious Cause

The rapidly spreading Western Civilisation in India was alarming concerns all over the country.
An act in 1850 changed the Hindu law of inheritance enabling a Hindu who had converted into Christianity to inherit his ancestral properties.
The people were convinced that the Government was planning to convert Indians to Christianity.
The abolition of practices like sati and female infanticide, and the legislation legalizing widow remarriage, were believed as threats to the established social structure.
Introducing western methods of education was directly challenging the orthodoxy for Hindus as well as Muslims
Even the introduction of the railways and telegraph was viewed with suspicion.
Economic Cause

In rural areas, peasants and zamindars were infuriated by the heavy taxes on land and the stringent methods of revenue collection followed by the Company.
Many among these groups were unable to meet the heavy revenue demands and repay their loans to money lenders, eventually losing the lands that they had held for generations.
Large numbers of sepoys belonged to the peasantry class and had family ties in villages, so the grievances of the peasants also affected them.
After the Industrial Revolution in England, there was an influx of British manufactured goods into India, which ruined industries, particularly the textile industry of India.
Indian handicraft industries had to compete with cheap machine- made goods from Britain.
Military Causes

The Revolt of 1857 began as a sepoy mutiny:
Indian sepoys formed more than 87% of the British troops in India but were considered inferior to British soldiers.
An Indian sepoy was paid less than a European sepoy of the same rank.
They were required to serve in areas far away from their homes.
In 1856 Lord Canning issued the General Services Enlistment Act which required that the sepoys must be ready to serve even in British land across the sea.
Lord Canning

Charles John Canning was the statesman and governor general of India during the Indian Mutiny of 1857.
He became the first viceroy of India in 1858.
The important events during his tenure include:
The Mutiny of 1857, which he was able to suppress successfully
Passing of Indian Councils Act, 1861 which introduced portfolio system in India
Withdrawal of “Doctrine of Lapse” which was one of the main reasons of mutiny of 1858
Introduction of Code of Criminal Procedure
Enactment of Indian High Courts Act
Indian Penal Code (1858)
Immediate Cause

The Revolt of 1857 eventually broke out over the incident of greased cartridges.
A rumour spread that the cartridges of the new enfield rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs.
Before loading these rifles the sepoys had to bite off the paper on the cartridges.
Both Hindu and Muslim sepoys refused to use them.
Lord Canning tried to make amends for the error and the offending cartridges were withdrawn but the damage had already been done. There was unrest in several places.
In March 1857, Mangal Pandey, a sepoy in Barrackpore, had refused to use the cartridge and attacked his senior officers.
He was hanged to death on 8th April.
On 9th May, 85 soldiers in Meerut refused to use the new rifle and were sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.
Centres of The Revolt
The revolt spread over the entire area from the neighbourhood of Patna to the borders of Rajasthan. The main centres of revolt in these regions namely Kanpur, Lucknow, Bareilly, Jhansi, Gwalior and Arrah in Bihar.
Lucknow: it was the capital of Awadh. Begum Hazrat Mahal, one of the begums of the ex-king of Awadh, took up the leadership of the revolt.
Kanpur: the revolt was led by Nana Saheb, the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II.
He joined the revolt primarily because he was deprived of his pension by the British.
The victory was short- lived. Kanpur was recaptured by the British after fresh reinforcements arrived.
The revolt was suppressed with terrible vengeance.
Nana Saheb escaped but his brilliant commander Tantia Tope continued the struggle.
Tantia Tope was finally defeated, arrested and hanged.
Jhansi: the twenty-two-year-old Rani Lakshmi Bai led the rebels when the British refused to accept the claim of her adopted son to the throne of Jhansi.
She fought gallantly against the British forces but was ultimately defeated by the English.
Gwalior: After Rani Lakshmi Bai escaped, she was joined by Tantia Tope and together they marched to Gwalior and captured it.
Fierce fighting followed where the Rani of Jhansi fought like a tigress but died, fighting to the very end.
Gwalior was recaptured by the British.
Bihar: the revolt was led by Kunwar Singh who belonged to a royal house of Jagdispur, Bihar.
Suppression and The Revolt
The Revolt of 1857 lasted for more than a year. It was suppressed by the middle of 1858.
On July 8, 1858, fourteen months after the outbreak at Meerut, peace was finally proclaimed by Lord Canning.

Why did the Revolt Fail?
Limited uprising: although the revolt was fairly widespread, a large part of the country remained unaffected by it.
The revolt was mainly confined to the Doab region.
The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion
The southern provinces did not take part in it.
No effective leadership: the rebels lacked an effective leader. Although Nana Saheb, Tantia Tope and Rani Lakshmi Bai were brave leaders, they could not offer effective leadership to the movement as a whole.
Limited resources: the rebels lacked resources in terms of men and money. The English, on the other hand, received a steady supply of men, money and arms in India.
No participation of the middle class: The English educated middle class, the rich merchants, traders and zamindars of Bengal helped the British to suppress the revolt.
Results of The Revolt
End of company rule: the great uprising of 1857 was an important landmark in the history of modern India.
The revolt marked the end of the East India Company’s rule in India.
Direct rule of the British Crown: India now came under the direct rule of the British Crown.
This was announced by Lord Canning at a Durbar in Allahabad in a proclamation issued on 1 November 1858 in the name of the Queen.
The Indian administration was taken over by Queen Victoria, which, in effect, meant the British Parliament.
The India office was created to handle the governance and the administration of the country.
Religious tolerance: it was promised and due attention was paid to the customs and traditions of India.
Administrative change: the Governor General’s office was replaced by that of the Viceroy.
The rights of Indian rulers were recognised.
The Doctrine of Lapse was abolished.
The right to adopt sons as legal heirs was accepted.
Military reorganisation: the ratio of British officers to Indian soldiers increased but the armoury remained in the hands of the English. It was arranged to end the dominance of the Bengal army.
Conclusion
The revolt of 1857 was an unprecedented event in the history of British rule in India. It united, though in a limited way, many sections of Indian society for a common cause.Though the revolt failed to achieve the desired goal, it sowed the seeds of Indian nationalism.

THE FIRST WAR OF
INDEPENDENCE 1857
CAUSES OF THE FIRST WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
• The first hundred years of British. rule in India i.e., from 1757 to 1857, were
marked by British conquests and rapid expansion of their dominion in
India.
• The combined effect of British expansionist policies, economic exploitation
and administrative changes adversely affected all segments of Indian
society. The ruling classes were dispossessed of their power; the peasantry
was deprived of its land rights; and the artisans lost their livelihood.
• The middle and upper-classes of Indian society, particularly in the northern
India, were annoyed because of their exclusion from the well-paid higher
posts in the administration.
• Men who followed cultural or religious activities, like priests and scholars,
found themselves without income as they lost their patrons — the Indian
rulers, princes and zamindars, who had themselves lost their authority.
• The company's Indian soldiers were discontented with their low pay, hard
life and the contemptuous treatment meted out to them by the British
officers.
• Thus, by 1857, conditions were ripe for a mass uprising and the accumulated
grievances of the people burst forth in the form of the First War of
Independence.

• Disrespect Shown To Bahadur Shah
• Treatment Given to Nana Saheb and Rani Laxmi Bai
• Absentee Sovereigntyship of the British
 POLICY OF EXPANSION
• The British policy of effective control and gradual
extinction of the native Indian States was one of the
major grievances of the Indian rulers.
• Ever since the Battle of Plassey (June 1757), the East
India Company's territorial power increased rapidly.
HOW EXPANDED POLITICAL POWER IN
INDIA
• The British tried to expand their political power in
India by adopting four ways, i.e., by
• outright wars
• system of Subsidiary Alliance
• Doctrine of Lapse
• alleged misrule.
EXPANSION OF THE EMPIRE
• The Battle of Buxar (1757) established the British as
masters of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.
• As a result of their success in Anglo-Mysore Wars
(1767 to 1797), the East India Company annexed
most of the territories of the Mysore State.
• After the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-18) , the
Peshwa's entire dominions and all Maratha territory
north and south of the Narmada river were
acquired by the British.
• The Punjab was annexed in 1849 after the Sikhs
were defeated in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. From
1823 to 1856, the British further extended their
empire by conquering Sindh, territories of Assam,
Arakan and Tenasserim and Pegu in Myanmar.
SUBSIDIARY ALLIANCE
• Some other Indian States were brought under the
British control without actually annexing them. This
was done by following the Subsidiary Alliance,
introduced by Lord Wellesley. Under this system, the
Indian rulers, who agreed to the Subsidiary Alliance
—
• accepted the British as the supreme power;
• agreed to maintain British troops at their own cost;
and
• virtually lost their independence.
• By 1856, practically all the Indian States had either
been annexed or had entered into alliances with
the Company.
• The British had become the supreme power and the
Indian princes were reduced to puppets
 DOCTRINE OF LAPSE
• Lord Dalhousie, Governor-General of India,
annexed many Indian States to the Company using
the Doctrine of Lapse.
• According to this Doctrine, heirs adopted without
the consent of the Company, could inherit only the
private property of the deceased ruler, and not his
territory, which would come under the Company's
rule.
 DOCTRINE OF LAPSE
• When the ruler of Jhansi died in 1853, leaving no natural
heir, the widowed Rani was pensioned and their
adopted son, Anand Rao, was not recognised as a
lawful successor to the throne.
• The other prominent States which became victims to the
Doctrine were Satara, Jaitpur, Sambalpur, Udaipur and
Nagpur.
• The principle of Lapse was also applied to take away the
titles and pensions of the rulers of some States.
• Regal titles of the Nawabs of Carnatic and Tanjore were
taken away.
• This caused discontentment among the rulers as well as
among the people in general.
• The rulers of Indian States believed that their States were
annexed not by the application of Doctrine of Lapse but
due to the 'lapse of all morals' on the part of the British.
ANNEXATION OF AWADH
• On February 13, 1856, Lord Dalhousie annexed
Awadh to the Company's dominions on the pretext
of alleged misrule.
• The annexation of Awadh was arbitrary as the British
seemed to have broken their promises made to the
ruling chiefs.
• This caused resentment among the Indians in
general and Awadh in particular.
ANNEXATION OF AWADH
• Lord Dalhousie justified the annexation of Awadh on
the pretext of "the good of the governed".
• But the people of Awadh, on the contrary, got no
good and had to face more hardships.
• They had to pay higher land revenue and
additional taxes on articles of food, houses, ferries
and justice.
• The dissolution of the Nawab of Awadh's aiiny and
administration threw thousands of nobles, officials
and soldiers out of jobs.
• The British confiscated the estates of the taluqdars
or zamindars.
• The dispossessed taluqdars became the opponents
of the British rule.
• The company's sepoys, of whom 75,000 were from
Awadh, were the worst affected.
• These soldiers had helped the British to conquer the rest
of India.
• But they did not like that their homelands should come
under the foreign sway.
• The annexation of Awadh also affected the soldier's
financial position.
• They had to pay higher taxes on the land their families
held in Awadh.
• In fact, Awadh played a major role in the uprising of
1857.
DISRESPECT SHOWN TO BAHADUR
SHAH
• Bahadur Shah, the Mughal ruler, was under the
protection of the Company and received a
pension from the British.
• In 1849, Lord Dalhousie announced that successors
of Bahadur Shah Zafar would not be permitted to
use the Red Fort as their palace.
• They were required to shift to a place near the
Qutab Minar.
DISRESPECT SHOWN TO BAHADUR
SHAH
• In 1856, Lord Canning announced that after the
death of Bahadur Shah, his successors would not be
allowed to use the imperial titles with their names
and would be known as mere princes.
• This decision of the British hurt the feelings of the
Muslims. Consequently, Zeenat Mahal, the wife of
Bahadur Shah, began plotting against them.
TREATMENT GIVEN TO NANA SAHEB
AND RANI LAXMI BAI
• Nana Saheb was the adopted son of Baji Rao II, the last
Peshwa.
• The British refused to grant Nana Saheb the pension they
were paying to Baji Raoli.
• Nana Saheb was forced to live at Kanpur, -far away
from his family seat at Poona. This was widely resented in
the Maratha region.
• Nana Saheb had inherited wealth from the former
Peshwa, which he utilised in sending emissaries to
different parts of the country for generating awareness
among the Indians about the British policies. Nana
Saheb travelled between Delhi and Lucknow to gather
support for the movement.
• Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi, who became the victim of
the Doctrine of Lapse, became a bitter enemy of
the British. The other Indian rulers, who were not
adversely affected, became suspicious, lest they
should meet the same fate.
ABSENTEE SOVEREIGNTYSHIP OF THE
BRITISH
• Absentee Sovereigntyship of the British rule was resented
by the Indians.
• This means that India was being ruled by the British
government from England, a distance of thousands of
miles.
• The earlier rulers like the Mughals, who had conquered
India, had in course of time, settled in India. The
revenues they collected from the Indians were spent in
this country only.
• But in the case of Britain, the Indians felt that they were
being ruled from England and India's wealth was being
drained to England and not utilised for their welfare.
